			If you're interested in working with me, I suggest getting to know more about my research first, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zunglbGC291TZ-1ff1X_BSEjU7vnQkXv/view">you can check out this talk</a> or <a href="../research.html">read some recent papers</a>. Note, I am not a pure NLP researcher and will not accept students wanting to just work on NLP. I am looking for students with a particular interest in human cognition and an affinity for machine learning (you don't have to know it all yet!). I want students who not only want to read the latest and greatest AI papers, but also want to dive into psychology or linguistics literature. If that's you, awesome and read on.

		</li>
		<li>
			<b>2.</b> Send me an email describing a research problem or question you're interested in and a couple sentences on why interdisciplinary work interests you. The email must have the subject line: "AI-cogsci supervision interest".
		</li>

	If all goes well I will contact you for an interview mid-winter. A note about program offerings: My home department is Decision Sciences at HEC Montréal, though I also have associate member status in CS at Université of Montréal, where I can solo supervise students. In either case, you would be Mila affiliated. The data science and computer science programs differ in their program requirements and offered courses. Pick the option that best suits your particular academic goals.
