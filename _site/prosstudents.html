Note, I am not a pure NLP researcher and will not accept students wanting to just work on NLP. I am looking for students with a particular interest in human cognition and an affinity for machine learning (you don't have to know it all yet!). I want students who not only want to read the latest and greatest AI papers, but also want to dive into psychology or linguistics literature. If that's you, awesome and read on. </p> <p> To apply for either a research masters and PhD program with me you will need to follow these steps: </p> <ul> <li> <b>1.</b> Submit a <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/prospective-students-and-postdocs/research-programs/request-supervisor"><u>Mila supervision request</u></a> and indicate that you would like to work with me; I will be listed under associate members. (closes Dec 1 2024) </li> <li> <b>2.</b> Send me an email describing a research problem or question you're interested in and a couple sentences on why interdisciplinary work interests you. The email must have the subject line: "AI-cogsci supervision interest". </li> <li> <b>3.</b> Apply to your program(s) of choice: <ol type="i"> <li> <a href="https://www.hec.ca/en/programs/masters/master-data-science-business-analytics/index.html"><u>Masters in data science</u></a> at HEC Montréal (English or French - applications close Jan 6th 2025) </li> <li> <a href="https://www.hec.ca/en/programs/phd/phd-data-science/index.html"><u>PhD in data science</u></a> at HEC Montréal (English - applications close Jan 6th 2025) </li> <li> <a href="https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/programs/graduate-programs/masters-in-computer-science/"><u>Masters in computer science</u></a> at Université de Montréal (French, many English classes - applications close Feb 1st 2025) </li> <li> <a href="https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/programs/graduate-programs/phd-in-computer-science/"><u>PhD in computer science</u></a> at Université de Montréal (French, many English classes - applications close Feb 1st 2025) </li> </ol> </li> </ul> </div> If all goes well I will contact you for an interview mid-winter. A note about program offerings: My home department is Decision Sciences at HEC Montréal, though I also have associate member status in CS at Université of Montréal, where I can solo supervise students. In either case, you would be Mila affiliated. The data science and computer science programs differ in their program requirements and offered courses. Pick the option that best suits your particular academic goals. </section> </article> <div class="page-navigation code"> <a class="home" href="http://localhost:4000/" title="Back to Index">&larr; Index</a> </div> </div> <div class="footer"> <span class="block">&copy; 2024 Eva Portelance</span> <span class="block"><small>&lt;/&gt; Powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain">The Plain theme</a>.</small></span> </div> </body> </html>
