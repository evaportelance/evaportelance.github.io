title: More About Me
---

Most of my time is actually not spent doing research, unsurprisingly! I love to spend time with my dog Dora, my family, and friends. I'm an avid cook, exploring all sorts of cuisines and fermentation techniques, and love to host open door Sunday dinners for loved ones. I also love the outdoors, camping, hiking, cross-country skiing, and biking. I try to walk or bike everywhere I go (in a previous life I helped run a community bike repair center)! Finally, I have a thing for beautiful textiles, my first degree was in textile design and to this day I still knit regularly. Fun fact: my first coding experience ever was programming Jacquard looms!
